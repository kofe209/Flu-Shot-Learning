# Flu-Shot-Learning
Flu shot predictions for the drivendata.org competition at https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/


Able to predict whether or not an individual would receive seasonal flu vaccines, based on a variety of backgrounds, opinions, and behaviors with an accuracy of 83%.

One of the interesting things I learned from this project is feature selection using Lasso and how to tune the number of features selected using alpha.
